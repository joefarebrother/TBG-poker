# TBG-poker
Just a little tool to help me keep track of a [game](http://tbgforums.com/forums/viewtopic.php?id=2343) on the TBG forums.

Usage: 
    $ pokertool.py                   # Prompts to add a new post
    $ pokertool.py -rep <currency>   # Print a report on the transactions in the selected currency
    $ pokertool.py -reprm <currency> # Prints a report and clears all transactions in it
